### Newton balls animation
I'm playing with CSS keyframes to build the Newton balls animated

### Instructions:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

### Demo
You can see it working [Here](http://newtonballs.s3-website.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/)
If you open it from a mobile device, you can "feel" the balls knocking!
